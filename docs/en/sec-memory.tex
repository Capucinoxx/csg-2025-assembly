\subsection*{Memory Model}
\noindent
The memory visible to an assembly program is segmented into two 
distinct parts: read-only memory (ROM) and write-only memory (RAM). 
Memory is addressed using unsigned integers of four (4) bytes. The 
following keywords are used:  
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{MEM (memory)} - An array of bytes representing the 
    read-only memory (ROM).  
  \item \texttt{MAP (mapping)} - An array of bytes representing the 
    write-only memory (RAM).  
\end{itemize}
